# tech-stocks-factor-model
This project analyzes how the rise of generative AI (2022-2023) altered the explanatory power of traditional asset-pricing factors for selected U.S. technology stocks. Using the Fama–French Five-Factor Model, a model describing stock returns,  we compare factor significance and explanatory strength before and during the AI-driven market boom.

The goal is to assess which factor is most significant for U.S technology stocks and to specifically answer the research question: "How did the **significance** and influence of Fama-French five factors change for technology stocks during the speculative **AI boom compared to non-AI-driven periods** and how were **AI-focused companies** impacted?"
